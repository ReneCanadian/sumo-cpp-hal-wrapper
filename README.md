# sumo-cpp-hal-wrapper-stm32-f4
Hi, I've created this repo to track my work on a sumo robot. I will be creating it based onthe `HAL` library but without using the `CubeMX` software. This means I'll be creating not only 
the code for the sumo but also a hal `wrapper`. Furthermore, I'll be using C++ as the main language I'll code in. I'll try to keep the consecutive `wrappers` well documented, but if you were to have any questions please write to me
and i'll try to answer your questions as well as i can :smiley:
